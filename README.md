## Features

The Pokemon Search application allows users to search for Pokemon by name. The application uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data about the Pokemon.

When a user enters a Pokemon name and clicks the "Search" button, the application fetches data about the Pokemon and displays it. The displayed information includes the Pokemon's name, weight, type, and a picture of the Pokemon.

If the user enters a name that does not correspond to a Pokemon, an error message is displayed under the search bar.

The application is styled with Tailwind CSS, and the Pokemon font is imported from a CDN.
